#### Finding all todos containing any keyword in their name: `find`
Finds todos whose names contain any of the given keywords.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD [AND] [MORE_KEYWORDS] [exact!]`

> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Project Meeting` will match `Meeting Project`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * By default, todos matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    The matching will only compare word stems of keywords. e.g. `Project Meeting` will match `Project Meeting` and `Meet teammates`
> * Only todos matching the exact keyword will be returned if the command contains the `exact!` parameter.
    e.g. `Meeting exact!` will match `Project Meeting` but will not match `Meet teammates`
> * Only todos matching both groups of keywords will be returned if the two groups of keywords are connected by `AND`
    (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `Project AND Meeting` will match `Project Meeting` but will not match `Meet teammates`

Examples:
* `find lecture`<br>
  Returns `CS2103 Lecture` and `lectures`
* `find lecture exact!`<br>
  Returns `CS2103 Lecture` but not `lectures`
* `find CS2103 Software Project`<br>
  Returns any todo having names `CS2103`, `Software`, or `Project`
* `find CS2103 AND Software Project`<br>
  Returns todos having names `CS2103` and at least one of `Software` or `Project`

Example: 
* `change /Desktop/folder/taskManager.xml`
* `change /Desktop/folder/taskManager.xml clear`

#### Undo operations: `undo`
Undo the most recent action (up to 5 times).<br>
Format: `undo`

> Able to undo add, delete, edit, clear, done commands from this session.

Undo the most recent change of the default storage location (up to 1 time) and clear data saved in the new location if specified.<br>
Format: `undochange [clear]` <br>

Example: 
* `undochange clear`

#### Redo operations: `redo`

Filter list for attributes such as start date, end date, deadline and tag.<br>
Format: `filter [s/START_DATE] [e/END_DATE] [d/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL] [t/TAG]...` 

> * Only todos that matching all attributes will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
> * If the given start date, end date or deadline is a day without time, corresponding dates that are on that day will be considered as matched. e.g. `3 Nov` will match `03.11.2016-12`, but `3 Nov 12 noon` will not match `03.11.2016`

Examples:
* `filter s/7.10.2016-14 t/CS2103` <br>
