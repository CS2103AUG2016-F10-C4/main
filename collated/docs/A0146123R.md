### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toDoList/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* stores the Task Manager states.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/toDoList/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task Manager data in xml format and read it back.
```

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`):


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.toDoList.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.toDoList.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.toDoList.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Task Manager depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>
c. [Natty] for natural language processing of time and date

## Appendix A : User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have)  - `* *`,  Low (unlikely to have) - `*`


Priority | As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can...
-------- | :-------- | :--------- | :-----------
`* * *` | new user | see usage instructions | refer to instructions when I forget how to use the App
`* * *` | user | add a task by specifying a task description only | record that need to be done ‘some day’
`* * *` | user | add a task with the deadline specified | record the task which needs to be done by a specified deadline
`* * *` | user | add an event by specifying the starting and ending time | record the exact details of the event 
`* * *` | user | edit  a task | update my tasks
`* * *` | user | delete a task | get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track
`* * *` | user | find a task by name | locate details of tasks without having to go through the entire list
`* * *` | user | specify a specific folder as the data storage location | choose to store the data file in a local folder controlled by a cloud syncing service, allowing me to access task data from multiple computers
`* *` | user | undo operation | recover from mistakes
`* *` | user | have some flexibility in the command format | do operations in an intuitively way
`* * ` | user | add tags to a task | categorize my tasks better
`* * ` | user with many tasks | filter tasks by attributes such as start time, deadline, tag, and priority | locate some tasks easily
`* ` | user | mark a task as done | monitor my task progression
`* ` | user | add a recurring task | save my troubles to retype my tasks
`*`  | user | refresh outdated recurring task or event | know the next upcoming date of the recurring tasks
`* ` | user | add priority level to a task| focus on more important tasks

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `toDoList` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

```
###### \DeveloperGuide.md
``` md
#### Use case 8: Find item

**MSS**

1. User requests to find items by keyword
2. toDoList shows a list of items
3. The users find the item that he/she is looking for

Use case ends.

**Extensions**

3a. The list of tasks contains so many items that the user still cannot find the item easily

> 3a1. The user adds one more keyword, connects the two keywords by  `AND` parameter, and adds the `exact!` parameter. <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2.

#### Use case 9: Clear toDoList

**MSS**

1. User requests to clear the toDoList
2. toDoList is cleared

User case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. User requests to undo the action

> 2a1. The action is undone and the toDoList is back to the previous state<br>
Use case ends.

**Todo.txt**<br>
* Strength<br>
  * It is offline and easy to start.
  * Users can quickly add a task by typing a command. 
  * Users can add context to a task.
  * Users can add priority to a task. Prioritized tasks are shown in different colors.
  * Users can mark a task as complete.<br>
* Weakness<br>
  * It does not support for events and deadlines.  
  * It does not support for undo operations. 
  * The UI is too simple.<br>

```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Finding all todos containing any keyword in their name: `find`
Finds todos whose names contain any of the given keywords.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD [AND] [MORE_KEYWORDS] [exact!]`

> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g hans will match Hans
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Project Meeting` will match `Meeting Project`
> * Only the name is searched.
> * By default, todos matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
    The matching will only compare word stems of keywords. e.g. `Project Meeting` will match `Project Meeting` and `Meet teammates`
> * Only todos matching the exact keyword will be returned if the command contains the `exact!` parameter.
    e.g. `Meeting exact!` will match `Project Meeting` but will not match `Meet teammates`
> * Only todos matching both groups of keywords will be returned if the two groups of keywords are connected by `AND`
    (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `Project AND Meeting` will match `Project Meeting` but will not match `Meet teammates`

Examples:
* `find lecture`<br>
  Returns `CS2103 Lecture` and `lectures`
* `find lecture exact!`<br>
  Returns `CS2103 Lecture` but not `lectures`
* `find CS2103 Software Project`<br>
  Returns any todo having names `CS2103`, `Software`, or `Project`
* `find CS2103 AND Software Project`<br>
  Returns todos having names `CS2103` and at least one of `Software` or `Project`
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
#### Changing default storage location: `change`
Default storage location will be changed to the location specified by the user. Any data saved in the previous location will be cleared if specified.<br>
Format: `change FILE_PATH [clear]`

> The file path must end with the file type extension, .xml

Example: 
* `change /Desktop/folder/taskManager.xml`
* `change /Desktop/folder/taskManager.xml clear`

#### Undo operations: `undo`
Undo the most recent action.<br>
Format: `undo`

> Able to undo add, delete, edit, clear, done commands from this session up to 10 times.

Undo the most recent change of the default storage location and clear data saved in the new location if specified. 
Format: `undochange [clear]` <br>

> There is no limit on the number of times.<br>

Example: 
* `undochange clear`

#### Redo operations: `redo`
Redo the most recent action that is undone.<br>
Format: `redo`<br><br>
Redo change the default storage location back to the new location.<br>
Format: `redochange` <br>

#### Filter todos: `filter`
Filter list for attributes such as start date, end date, deadline and tag.<br>
Format: `filter [s/START_DATE] [e/END_DATE] [d/DEADLINE] [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL] [t/TAG]...` 

> * Only todos that matching all attributes will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
> * If the given start date, end date or deadline is a day without time, corresponding dates that are on that day will be considered as matched. e.g. `3 Nov` will match `03.11.2016-12`, but `3 Nov 12 noon` will not match `03.11.2016`
> * `d/` will match tasks without deadline

Examples:
* `filter s/7.10.2016-14 t/CS2103` <br>
  List events that start from 7.10.2016-14 and have tag CS2103.

## GUI
<img src="images/Ui.png" width="600"><br>

#### Command box
It is for users to enter commands.

#### Result Display
It is for displaying results of commands.

#### Filter Panel
It provides a shortcut for user to filter and list todos. User can switch to the panel by using mouse or following shortcut-commands:
* s: Jump to the start date text field
* e: Jump to the end date text field
* d: Jump to the deadline text field
* r: Jump to the recurring text field
* t: Jump to the tags text field
* p: Jump to the priority choice box

> * Only items that matching all attributes will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
> * `NIL` in the deadline text field will match tasks without deadline.

The filter panel will also be updated after `list` and `filter` commands.
(Screen shot to be added)

#### Todos Panel
It is for displaying todos.
