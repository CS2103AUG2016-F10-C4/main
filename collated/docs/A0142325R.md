### Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

#### Adding an item: `add`
Add an event with a starting and ending date to the toDoList.<br>
Format: `add n/EVENT_NAME s/START_DATE e/END_DATE [t/TAG]... [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL][r/RECURRING_FREQUENCY]`

Add a task (with or without deadline) to the toDoList.<br>
Format: `add n/TASK_NAME [d/DEADLINE] [t/TAG]... [p/PRIORITY_LEVEL][r/RECURRING_FREQUENCY]`

> With the exception of command word "add", the order of parameters are not fixed. START_DATE, END_DATE
>and DEADLINE can be entered in natural language. For example, entering words like today, tommorrow, today
>at 4pm, the day after tommorrow are recognized. For events, START_DATE and END_DATE must be present at the
>same time

> Items to be added can have any number of tags (including 0)<br>

Examples:
* `add n/Lecture s/7.10.2016-14 e/7.10.2016-16 t/CS2103 p/3 r/daily`
* `add n/Project Deadline d/14.10.2016 t/CS2103 p/3 r/weekly`

> INDEX must be positive integers like 1 , 2 , 3 ...

Format:`delete NAME...`<br>
